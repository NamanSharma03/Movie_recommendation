# Movie_recommendation
Hey Guyz!In this project i have taken some dataset consisting of various fields such as movie_id, title	cast,	crew etc
below is the link for the datasets
/kaggle/input/tmdb-movie-metadata/tmdb_5000_credits.csv
/kaggle/input/tmdb-movie-metadata/tmdb_5000_movies.csv
In this  I have used 
Content Based Filtering
In this recommender system the content of the movie (overview, cast, crew, keyword, tagline etc) is used to find its similarity with other movies.
Then the movies that are most likely to be similar are recommended.
